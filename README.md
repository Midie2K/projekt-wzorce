# Project Patterns

**Project Patterns** is a simple library application designed to showcase the implementation of design patterns such as Singleton, Iterator, and Builder.

## Features

- Browse all books in the library.
- View available books.
- Borrow books.
- Return borrowed books.
- Add new books to the repository.

## Design Patterns

- **Singleton**: Singleton pattern ensures that there is only one instance of the book repository manager class, providing a global access point to the repository.
  
- **Iterator**: Iterator pattern is used to iterate through the list of books in the repository, enabling easy traversal and manipulation of the collection without exposing its internal representation.
  
- **Builder**: Builder pattern is used to create book objects, allowing the creation of complex objects step by step and providing flexibility in managing the object creation process.
